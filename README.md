### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working with Quantum Security and contribute to their XDR+SOC platform.
- ðŸ’» Most of my code is private, but from time to time I may contribute or add to public projects.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I worked for Mozilla as a member of their Information Security team which is where I began learning to code in Python and met some amazing folks.
